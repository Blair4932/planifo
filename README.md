Planifo - the all in one personal project planner. 

After trying to use other project planning softwares like Jira and Clickup, I found a lot of their functionality overkill.
That's where Planifo comes in. Create and manage your projects with tasks, sprints and milestones - perfect for individuals looking to boost their portfolio or even small businesses. 

Planifo is built in NextJS with a Postgresql db. It is currently still in development and is only fully supported on desktop. But this is slowly changing.
